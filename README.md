Virtual Reality Simulator for Offensive Linemen

The problem: Many young (college) offensive linemen face the problem of not having enough awareness or fast enough reaction when the Defense runs certain pressures/games/blitzes which ends up in less playing time, even if they are physically expelling; coaches won't let someone play who is insecure in these areas.

With this software, one can create every possible pressure/game/blitz play and run their own offensive play against it with the help of a Virtual Reality Headset (momentarily only the Oculus Quest 2 is compatible, but in the future this software will be usable with every headset) to further enhance their understanding and reaction.

Especially during summer training, due to NCAA rules, practices are not allowed and thus reaction and awareness against defensive movement can't be practiced properly. With this Software you can train it anywhere and anytime you want.

YOU MAY NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSES WITHOUT BUYING THE PRODUCT

However, I am looking for testers and developers. You can obviously make pull requests any time you want and if I accept them, you will be granted part of the money if the software sells; we obviously would have to come to an agreement on who takes how much money, but I'm sure we will if you email me, I don't bite :D.
